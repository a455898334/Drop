================

Nothing is currently operational. It uses HTML5 Geolocation API to get lat/lon and that works fine. 

HTML works like this:

There's a global varible named "mode" in app.py. <br>
If mode is empty, Jinja only shows main selection page. <br>
If mode is NEW, then it shows the "create message" page. <br>
If mode is SCAN, then it shows messages within the area. <br>

Everything is efficiently in one HTML document.






<h3>I rewrote HTML/javascript, should be good. </h3>
<h4>app.py is not yet rewritten. </h4> That is Saturday or if I'm done with Macro book report early.

I did something similar for pd7-miniproject1.

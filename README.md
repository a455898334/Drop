================

This project is to make an app (a website) that can store messages at locations (GPS). 

The main  page displays option, SCAN, NEWMESSAGE, LOGIN (to be implemented)  
The SCAN page displays all messages stored at that coordinate.
The NEW page allows you to create a new message at that coordinate.
The LOGIN (to be implemented)


It uses HTML5 Geolocation API to get lat/lon and that works fine. 

<h3>I rewrote HTML/javascript, should be good. </h3>
<h4>app.py is rewritten. </h4>

<h1>DROP</h1>
<h2>Summary</h2>
This project locates the user and allows the user to drop a message. Anyone who comes in the area on a later date will be allowed to view the dropped message.
We created a map so people can view where people dropped messages. Although we understand this can be seen as a stalker map, we felt it would be nice to know the locations of dropped messages.

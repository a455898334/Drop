================

This project is to make an app (a website) that can store messages at locations (GPS).  <br>

The main  page displays option, SCAN, NEWMESSAGE, LOGIN (to be implemented)  <br>
The SCAN page displays all messages stored at that coordinate. <br>
The NEW page allows you to create a new message at that coordinate. <br>
The LOGIN (to be implemented) <br>


It uses HTML5 Geolocation API to get lat/lon and that works fine. 

<h3>I rewrote HTML/javascript, should be good. </h3>
<h4>app.py is rewritten. </h4>

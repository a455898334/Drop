================

Nothing is currently operational. It uses HTML5 Geolocation API to get lat/lon and that works fine. 

HTML works like this:

There's a global varible named "mode" in app.py. 

If mode is empty, Jinja only shows main selection page.

If mode is NEW, then it shows the "create message" page.

If mode is SCAN, then it shows messages within the area. 

Everything is efficiently in one HTML document.


I rewrote HTML/javascript, should be good.
app.py is not yet rewritten. That is Saturday or if I'm done with Macro book report early.

I did something similar for pd7-miniproject1.
